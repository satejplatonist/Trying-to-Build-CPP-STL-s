# Trying-to-Build-CPP-STL-s

👨💻THIS REPOSITORY IS JUST FOR FUN 🧨

⚠☢☣ **DISCLAIMER** 

   1) I HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT STL LIBRARIES IN C++.
   2) THESE LIBRARIES MOSTLY HAVE NOT USE ANY FORM OF GUIDANCE TO BE MADE.
      2.1) I HAVE NOT USED ANY WEBSITE TO MAKE THIS.
      2.2) NEITHER HAVE I LOOKED FOR ORIGNAL STRUCTURE OF THOSE LIBRARIES.
      2.3) NOT USED CPP-REFERENCE OR ANY BOOKS.
      
   3) I HAVE JUST SEEN FUNCTIONALITIES OF THOSE FUNCTIONS AND TRIED TO MAKE IT.
   4) THESE ARE NOT SAFE .
   5) NEITHER ARE STRICTLY TYPED.
   6) IT CAN BE PRONE TO SEVERE CRASHES AND ERRORS & PROBLEMS WORSE THAN THIS.
   7) DON'T TRY TO USE IT .(I KNOW YOU WILL NOT , BUT STILL😂😁😅😜😆 )

😎😏 GOOD PART 😏😎
   
   1} I AM TRYING TO IMPROVE IT !!
   2} TRYING TO MAKE IT SAFE AND ADD NEW PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONALITIES !!
   3} I WILL ALSO CHECK FOR SOME REFERENCES !!
   4} TRYING TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND IMPROVING MY MISTAKES 
   
🛑😉 JUST ONE MORE THING KEEP WATCH ON 🧐NEW AND HOPEFULLY IMPROVED STUFF !!!
